## About the data used in this project

### Comulative incidence by age group

This data is associated by the file "spaincovidiaedad.csv" inside the data folder. Every row is a CCAA where it's segmentated the data of the comulative incidence by age group by every day. Altough I tried to be the most clear possible, here is the explanation of every column:

- CCAA: The CCAA which the data refears.
- menos11: Age group from 0 to 11 years.
- de12a19: Age group from 12 to 19 years.
- de20a29: Age group from 20 to 29 years.
- de30a39: Age group from 30 to 39 years.
- de40a49: Age group from 40 to 49 years.
- de50a59: Age group from 50 to 59 years.
- de60a69: Age group from 60 to 69 years.
- de70a79: Age group from 70 to 79 years.
- mas80: Age group over 80 years.
- fecha: the date where the data is caught.
- number_file: the number of file to get the next data. The url is: https://www.sanidad.gob.es/profesionales/saludPublica/ccayes/alertasActual/nCov/documentos/Actualizacion_553_COVID-19.pdf
